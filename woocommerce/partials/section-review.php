                <h4>Senior Dog Nahla is as Healthy as Ever</h4>
                <p class="date">16 June, 2023</p>
                <p>I've been using Beg n Bark and Woof Wonder for my dog Nahla for some time. After a recent vet visit, we discussed the importance of using a supplement for liver health as our girl enters her golden years. I found iPRO-SUPPORT and have been sprinkling it on her food for a couple of weeks now. It's easy for me to give to her and she's as happy and active as ever!</p>
